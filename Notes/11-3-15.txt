Bobbie:
	so no compilitation errors, just logic ones. 
	8 unit tests failing, (haven't even tried acceptance)
	optional and positional are now subclass of Argument
	Argument is a parent class but it's not abstract like we 			talked about, mostly cause couldn't get it to work
	different keys to keep track of opt and pos args
	took out getnumberof___ added numberof___ finds the 
		number of the different list
	no need for copy
	added false to all the addOpt in ArgumentTests.java
	haven't changed Keywords.java yet
	added addDefaultType and a map for it
